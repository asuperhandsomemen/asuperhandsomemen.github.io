These two buildings will continuously create low-intensity non-player character minions. The opponent's unit contacts. Players must control the hero, advance with their own team's minions into the opposing team's base, and destroy the opposing team's main base to win the game. Between the roads is a neutral area called the wild area, and inside there are non-player characters that do not belong to both players, called -- wild monsters. In addition, there is a river extending from the upper left to the lower right. Although it is called a river, it does not hinder the movement. Heroes can walk on it freely, which is the same as walking in other places on the map, but it will interact with some runes or hero skills. . In addition, the element canyon is that when the second flying dragon of the game is killed, the summoner canyon will acquire the attributes of the flying dragon that will be reborn, and the canyon will change drastically.";
