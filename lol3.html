<p class="message3">The Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) is an annual League of Legends tournament hosted by publisher Riot Games since 2015. It is the second most important international League of Legends tournament aside from the World Championship</p><br>

<p class="subtitle3">Championship Series</p><br>
<p class="message3">On February 7, 2013, Riot Games created the League of Legends Championship Series (LCS) in Europe and North America. This is a league system where ten teams compete. A season consists of two splits, with each split separated into a regular season and playoffs. The top teams from each region advance to the World Championship at the end of the season.</p><br>

<p class="subtitle3">Regional leagues</p><br>
<p class="message3">In late 2018, the European League of Legends Championship Series (EU LCS) was renamed to the League of Legends European Championship (LEC). The North American League of Legends Championship Series (NA LCS) also dropped "North American" from its name,[20] and was renamed to simply the League Championship Series ahead of the 2021 season. Equivalent leagues, run by Riot and local publishers, also exist in other regions such as the Pro League (LPL) in China by Tencent, Champions Korea (LCK) in South Korea, the Pacific Championship Series (PCS) in Taiwan/Hong Kong/Macau/Southeast Asia and the Vietnam Championship Series (VCS) by Garena, the Campeonato Brasileiro (CBLOL) in Brazil, the Continental League (LCL) in the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Japan League (LJL), the Liga Latinoamérica (LLA) in Latin America, the Turkish Championship League (TCL) in Turkey and the Circuit Oceania (LCO) by ESL Australia and Guinevere Capital.
