		<p class="message2">Right now, there are a total of 159 champions, with the latest one being Renata. When League of Legends was first released back in 2009, there were 40 champions, and from there, new champions have continuously been added. The iconic 100th released champion was Draven.</p><br>

		<p class="message2">Not only are there a lot of champions to choose from, but you also have a variety of heroes.<b> With two teams consisting of 5 different champions</b>, youâ€™re looking at 3.7 X 1021 of possible team versus team matchups. Plus, you also have to consider that a lot of the champions can be played in multiple roles and positions. </p>

<p class="subtitle2">K/DA</p>
<p class="message2">K/DA is a virtual K-pop girl group consisting of four themed versions of League of Legends characters: Ahri, Akali, Evelynn and Kaisa. American singers Madison Beer, Jaira Burns, and (G)I-dle members Miyeon and Soyeon provide the voices of Evelynn, Kai'Sa, Ahri, and Akali respectively, though the characters have also been voiced by other artists.</p><br>
<p class="message2">K/DA was developed by Riot Games, the company behind League of Legends, and unveiled at the 2018 League of Legends World Championship with an augmented reality live performance of their first song, "Pop/Stars". A music video of the song uploaded to YouTube subsequently went viral, surpassing 100 million views in one month, reaching 497 million views as of February 2022, and topping Billboard's World Digital Song Sales chart. This would be followed up with the release of an EP in 2020 entitled All Out, which featured 5 new songs including the pre-released single "The Baddest" and the lead single "More" which later received a music video that gained over 140 million views as of February 2022.</p>
