<p class="message1">	League of Legends (LoL), commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre. Since its release in October 2009, the game has been free-to-play and is monetized through purchasable character customization.</p><br>
<p class="message1">In the game, two teams of five players battle in player versus player combat, each team occupying and defending their half of the map. Each of the ten players controls a character, known as a "champion", with unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, champions become more powerful by collecting experience points, earning gold, and purchasing items to defeat the opposing team. In the game's main mode, Summoner's Rift, a team wins by pushing through to the enemy base and destroying their "Nexus", a large structure located within.</p><br>
<p class="message1">	Regularly cited as the world's largest esport, the game has an international competitive scene consisting of 12 leagues. These domestic leagues culminate in the annual League of Legends World Championship. The 2019 event registered over 100 million unique viewers, peaking at a concurrent viewership of 44 million. Domestic and international events have been broadcast on livestreaming websites such as Twitch, YouTube, Bilibili, and on cable television sports channel ESPN.</p><hr>

Demacian heroes value spirits like honor and chivalry, while Noxian heroes are ruthless and strategic. Piltover and Zaun are two high-tech city-states. Piltover's style is steampunk, while Zaun is good at biochemical research. The Freljord is the northern ice kingdom where three tribes are at war, led by Ashe, Sejuani and Lissandra.

Ionia is an island city-state, they develop unique martial arts, and have swordsmen, ninjas, monks and other types of characters.
